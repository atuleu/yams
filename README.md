# Yet Another Media Server (and a stupid one)

A very simple but hopefully effective media server using libvlc / Qt.

 * A single layer
 * A single cue list
 * Can eat any format.
 * Start Stop Next Prev Repeat continue Control
 * Global opacity control
 * Controllable by MIDI / Artnet.

 It aims to setup in second a media cue list and integrate it with a
 video console. Don't do advanced composition with it, look for real
 software for this, such as resolume/modul8.
